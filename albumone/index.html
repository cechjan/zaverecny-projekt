                                        When I was a young boy I went down to the county fair <br>
                                        Brought myself a nickel, bought a pickle, had change to spare <br>
                                        Thought I'd spend a cent or two to see what the robots could do <br>
                                        <br>
                                        There were wires all around <br>
                                        Electrical sounds <br>
                                        Steam from their exhausts <br>
                                        Gears and coils all criss-crossed (Ah, ah, ah ha ha, Eay!) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Everybody's going to the clockwork vaudeville <br>
                                        Everybody wants to see the show <br>
                                        People crowd the door and scream and shout for more <br>
                                        While music and song fill the air <br>

                                        There were four metal people dressed oh so sharply <br>
                                        They sung and danced a catchy tune with automaton robotic ease <br>
                                        Their guitar strings hummed to the beat kept by their tambourine <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Boilers making steam (ah ha ha ha ha) <br>
                                        Metal gleaming (ah ha ha ha ha) <br>
                                        Songs with a good tune (ah ha ha ha ha) <br>
                                        That would stick with you all through the afternoon (Ooo, ooo, ooo who who) <br>

                                        (He had a moustache) <br>
                                        And asked me if I'd like to meet the robots up close, the robots up close <br>
                                        (Not programmed to bite) <br>
                                        Well they greeted me and one shook my hand, one shook my hand <br>

                                        And asked me if I'd like to join his robot band, I said oh yeah <br>

                                        down by the sea <br>
                                        <br>
                                        At age thirteen <br>
                                        everyday after school <br>
                                        he would always sail around the lake <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All the people would stand and stare <br>
                                        as he sailed around with precision and care <br>
                                        With his bi-corner hat and the way he would stand <br>
                                        he looked just like a Navy man <br>
                                        All the townsfolk would gather and say, and sing away <br>

                                        By age twenty four <br>
                                        he had left the shore <br>
                                        and was sailing for the Queen <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On a dark starry night <br>
                                        Albert awoke to the sound <br>
                                        of his Captain screaming as he was drowned <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The Navy crew was taking a lick <br>
                                        pirates had invaded the ship <br>
                                        But Albert with one aimed harpoon <br>
                                        ignited their rum with a spark and soon <br>
                                        flames drove the pirates away <br>
                                        the Navy sang <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Saved his crew from pirate slaughter <br>
                                        But that Captain Albert Alexander <br>
                                        He'll go down in the water <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Now everyone dance <br>
                                        Dance. Dance. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Twenty some odd years later <br>
                                        On his ship The Sea Slater <br>
                                        He sailed into a mass of blubber <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Gazing up to the sky <br>
                                        stood a large walrus <br>
                                        that was a hundred stories high, it meant no harm <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The walrus was in a great deal of pain <br>
                                        It suffered from a tusk with tooth decay <br>
                                        Albert threw his anchor 'round it's tusk <br>
                                        with a little bit of pulling it was out by dusk <br>
                                        The walrus thanked Albert and sang, as he sailed away <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Captain Albert Alexander <br>
                                        Friend to sea urchin and me <br>
                                        But that Captain Albert Alexander <br>
                                        He'll go down in the sea <br>
                                        <br>
                                        At a ripe old age lightning struck from the sky <br>
                                        and split Albert's vessel in two <br>
                                        One hundred men fled for their lives <br>
                                        on rafts across the ocean blue <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Albert stood at the stern of his ship <br>
                                        A giant octopus had him in it's grip <br>
                                        A vortex of spiraling death below ripped <br>
                                        and sharks and electric eels all made the trip <br>
                                        to see Albert <br>
                                        sink to the bottom of the sea <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Just before he went down <br>
                                        he called out to his crew <br>
                                        It's obvious that my time has come <br>
                                        I'll let this ending ensue <br>
                                        I've led an exciting nautical life it would seem <br>
                                        and there's no better end than a death by the sea <br>
                                        His crew sang <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Captain Albert Alexander <br>
                                        He went down in the sea <br>
                                        But that Captain Albert Alexander <br>
                                        He'll go down in history <br>
                                        <br>
                                        That Captain Albert Alexander <br>
                                        He went down in the sea  <br>

                                        shot holes in cans without a missin' <br>
                                        sadly they were in the pantry <br>
                                        so beans painted the whole darn kitchen <br>
                                        <br>
                                        His parents then let him shoot <br>
                                        the empty cans out on their fence <br>
                                        but Rex trick shot out all the nails <br>
                                        so out the fence all their cows went <br>
                                        <br>
                                        His father cried <br>

                                        He made quick-reloading gadgets <br>
                                        so he could fire non-stop with panache and flare <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He became a gun for hire <br>

                                        he disarmed forty bandits one time <br>
                                        with two gunshots all on his own <br>

                                        Rex Marksley <br>
                                        When it came to gun slinging he was the best <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He had heart and a righteous stand <br>
                                        and they tell of his stories across the land <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He jammed the guns that fired his way <br>
                                        by shooting bullets into their barrels they say <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He shot lightning from his hands with a miraculous invention, <br> 
                                        and zapped that evil demon train back to it's own dimension <br>
                                        <br>
                                        That giant copper ore golem, oh it was a fright,  <br>
                                        till Rex projectiled pick axes with dynamite <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He fought the corrupt Rattlesnake King and it hissed in agony,  <br>
                                        then Rex taught all the jackalopes to yodel in harmony <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Here we go now! <br>
                                        <br>

                                        <br>
                                        Rex Marksley rode across the West bringing justice to the land <br>
                                        He tamed enormous vultures, reined and flew them with one hand <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All the women blushed and fainted when Rex winked his eye <br>
                                        and the bad guys always fell to their demise <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The man was a legend and hero through and through <br>
                                        and Rex was a friend to the battered and the bruised <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He had seen a lot of wonderments in his glory days <br>
                                        and he died an old man alone on the prairie they say <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Rex Marksley <br>

                                        I've awakened to the same thing <br>
                                        Other automaton friends roughly built like me <br>
                                        <br>

                                        and black oil dripped from my lips  <br>

                                        One moonlight night in the bayou a silhouette <br>
                                        The air was sweet and the fog was vi-o-let <br>
                                        The gators were all drinking tea, in a dreamy pantsless glee <br>
                                        I saw a suspendered man, a banjo holstered in his hands. <br>
                                        He had biggest red suspenders I ever did see, golly gee that's what I've seen <br>
                                        He flicked the brim of his hat, and this is what he said to me. <br>
                                        "Mister robut ah am The Suspender Man <br>
                                        And dis banjo 'as shown me dah promised land. <br>
                                        Now ah play a song but in return, yoo put dat shiny coin right 'ere in mah urn. <br>
                                        And ah play yoo sumfin fine. Mah music gonna blow yo mind!" <br>
                                        So I flicked my coin into his pot, I gotta admit it twasn't a lot <br>
                                        Two cents and then his fingers wriggled,  <br>
                                        he plucked those strings and belched a giggle. <br>
                                        He tapped his foot, howled like a hound <br>
                                        Igniting up the unholy sound. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        And I ain't never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, <br>
                                        never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, <br>
                                        never, never, never, never, never, heard anything so great. <br>

                                        Call the vendors. <br>
                                        Big Suspenders. <br>
                                        That's what everybody wants to wear. <br>
                                        They stretch to Nantucket. <br>
                                        Put them in a bucket <br>
                                        And send them to the gnome trapped down the well <br>
                                        (Tug 'em with thumbs is ideal) <br>
                                        (While rollin' back on your heels) <br>
                                        (Yeah) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He played the two cent show <br>
                                        <br>
                                        And just like that he stopped playing <br>
                                        My jaw dropped to the floor. <br>
                                        He cracked his neck and smiled at me, <br>
                                        And said,  <br>
                                        "Buddy, y'gotta pay for more!" <br>
                                        But by then a crowd had swarmed the swamp,  <br>
                                        tossin' coin in after coin.  <br>
                                        So he cleared his throat, and his fingers writhed,  <br>
                                        and everyone shouted for Suspender Guy. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Call the vendors <br>

                                        He played the two cent show <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Those banjo sounds instill a trance <br>

                                        Suspender Man on the front page spot <br>
                                        Suspenders were in and spats were out <br>
                                        The girls all suffered from fainting bouts <br>
                                        The banjos flew off the shelves <br>
                                        Sprouting wings with dreams  <br>
                                        of being played by Suspender Man. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But in the middle of February <br>
                                        the fog turned a crimson red <br>
                                        The Suspender Man disappeared,  <br>
                                        everyone was heels over head <br>
                                        But we found his suspenders and that old banjo  <br>
                                        sittin' right there on his log <br>
                                        <br>
                                        And though he's gone,  <br>
                                        that's what he gets  <br>
                                        for selling his soul to the bog <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Big Suspenders <br>
                                        Put them in a blender <br>
                                        Three bat teeth and a blackened gypsy eye <br>
                                        Bring it to a boil <br>
                                        Release your mortal coil <br>
                                        Out pops a belt to wear for you and me- <br>
                                        Nobody wants their pants to fall down- <br>
                                        You could wear a dress and then...you'd have no need <br>
                                        (The alligators had it right) <br>
                                        (Wearing pants it sure does bite) <br>
                                        (Yeah) <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Her father fought in the great war <br>
                                        In an aeroplane named Bree <br>
                                        He gave his love to a pretty girl  <br>
                                        And said, "Baby you're the one for me" <br>
                                        And though her name was Bree,  <br>
                                        He still found it all a shock <br>
                                        When he found out she was an airplane,  <br>
                                        The stork began to knock <br>
                                        <br>
                                        A baby girl was born  <br>
                                        With air rudders on her back <br>
                                        She picked up airwave frequencies  <br>
                                        And petrol was her favorite snack <br>
                                        Whale she bubbled noises like an airplane  <br>
                                        Every time she sang <br>
                                        And her heart it loved so hungrily,  <br>
                                        And roared like a Mustang <br>
                                        <br>
                                        That's why they called her <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        That girl was meant to fly <br>
                                        So prep the runway <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        That girl will soar away <br>
                                        <br>
                                        She was an angel in her blue dress  <br>
                                        When Little Jimmy Wright took her to prom <br>
                                        The young pilot said he loved her,  <br>
                                        And oil began to clam her palm <br>
                                        Well he was lost in the sky  <br>
                                        And they said he had died,  <br>
                                        But I know something more <br>
                                        They only found Jimmy's goggles, <br>
                                        In his plane upon the floor <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Well years went by  <br>
                                        And she still looked to the sky, <br>
                                        Her feelings did not disperse <br>
                                        She could fly any plane just like an ace <br>
                                        And kept goggles in her purse <br>
                                        And she swore she still heard Jimmy singing, "That'll Be the Way Home" <br>
                                        It would haunt her from her radio  <br>
                                        In each sky that she would roam <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Jimmy's voice echoed <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        I'm sorry that I flew away <br>
                                        But just remember <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        Keep flapping and you'll soar one day <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Lets Fly! <br>
                                        Do you wanna sail into the sky? <br>
                                        Soar across the stars? <br>
                                        Sail into the sky? <br>
                                        Soar across the stars? <br>
                                        Sail into the sky? <br>
                                        Soar across the stars? <br>
                                        The stars? <br>
                                        The stars?! <br>
                                        The stars! <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Then one fateful day  <br>
                                        Ended with a storm streaked sky <br>
                                        Her plane crashed into the mountain side,  <br>
                                        Was she flying much too high? <br>
                                        They only found Jimmy's goggles  <br>
                                        In her plane upon the floor <br>
                                        I hope she's up there somewhere with him  <br>
                                        Kissing on a cloudy shore <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The birds were singing <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        Airheart <br>
                                        That girl was meant to fly <br>
                                        So prep the runway <br>
                                        Airheart <br>

                                        more like a circus wheel <br>

                                        and of coarse there's giraffes <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Just give in <br>

                                        The malt shop's a derelict skelly'ton <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The disco's dead and the hop is done <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The raves are flickering out, and your future flings follow en route <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Lets drive the Cadillac into the sea <br>

                                        Its got transmission in my memory <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Reminiscing in retrograde will fuel our pointless escapade <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I'll rust with you <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I'll rust with every one of you <br>

                                        <br>
                                        It's a suit and tie affair and you're only wearing shoes <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Although they're pretty slick, no one will let you through <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Well, it doesn't matter those fancy shoes, it's all about the words you choose <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It doesn't matter those fancy shoes, it's all about the friends you’ll lose <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It doesn't matter those fancy shoes, so why would, why would you? <br>
                                        I can see where there may be some confusion, I was once just like you <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Let me tell you a story to clarify the matter, once upon a time a mouse put on some shoes <br>
                                        Hey friend, where'd you get those fancy shoes, <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Are you wearing them, or are they wearing you <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I've seen you walking down the boulevard, <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You must've come pretty far, you make it look real hard <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Those shoes, sparkle gold and blue, always seem brand new, <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Must've set you back a few <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Oh my, fancy shoes distract me, I’m in the path of a bus in the <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Middle of a busy street <br>
                                        You can fix a robot, buff out the dents <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Strap him into a pair of fancy shoes and, flip the switch to commence <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But when all's said and done, are the shoes built for fun? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Or to protect from broken glass or toe biters in tall grass? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        When everyones in red, you wear blue <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It's just like you to ignore simple truths   <br>
                                        Well, it doesn't matter those fancy shoes, it's all about the words you choose <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It doesn't matter those fancy shoes, it's all about the friends you’ll lose <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It doesn't matter those fancy shoes, it's all about the toes you'll lose <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It doesn't matter those fancy shoes, so why would, why would you? <br>

                                        a young lady <br>

                                        <br>
                                        Her smile stays the same <br>
                                        <br>
                                        There is a woman <br>
                                        <br>

                                        But that smile it still came back <br>
                                        After the curtain <br>

                                        A tiny dancer spins <br>

                                        A little girl sits <br>
                                        <br>
                                        And she's laughin’ <br>
                                        She looks just like her <br>
                                        <br>
                                        With her golden curls <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The smile's there <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It's not the same smile <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Where'd my girl run to <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Will she be back soon? <br>
                                        I see her now <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Smiling <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Hey now, <br>

                                        <br>
                                        Dancing in that light (x3) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On a crescendo <br>
                                        making the best of it all <br>
                                        On a crescendo <br>
                                        now we can fly and not fall <br>
                                        <br>

                                        we could lose sight <br>
                                        But we have heard our screams <br>
                                        And woe isn't happening <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Darker days may have been <br>
                                        a little more hectic back then <br>
                                        But we now have the tools <br>
                                        and our sorrows melt to pools <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On a crescendo <br>

                                        I certainly am, a long way from home, but that’s ok, I was built to explore <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Powered by, steam and purpose pie, to search for, a home away from home <br>

                                        I must carry on, until the last drop <br>

                                        It's a difficult thing to define, a love for a world I’ve yet to find, <br>
                                        I mean I know that she is out there, and folks are counting on me to find her <br>

                                        That's just fine with me, because it doesn't look all that fake to me <br>
                                        The particles that we are are deconstructed here and reassembled afar <br>
                                        And that's just fine with me, 'cause it's the only way to travel overseas <br>

                                        The science of all things in this world of ours <br>
                                        is understood now and reaching afar <br>
                                        across all manner of time and space <br>
                                        There's no time for breaking down <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The knowledge of all is fed right to our minds <br>
                                        and nobody dies now they live on through time <br>
                                        with computer simulations of their brain <br>

                                        Your heart stops at twenty five but it's alright <br>
                                        they digitally fabricate one over night <br>
                                        and beam it into your chest while you’re asleep <br>
                                        I can't fathom all of this <br>

                                        Happiness sits in the palm of your hand <br>
                                        and you dial a feeling and get it right then <br>
                                        and your outward appearance is made just for you <br>
                                        Please take this away from me <br>
                                        I now have everything <br>
                                        It's just the greatest thing <br>

                                        It's all we have and want and saves us from ourselves <br>
                                        We head straight for the future not certain of what's in store <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Time will tell a tale of all that we have done, it's all for tomorrow, it's all for the betterment of our <br>

                                        A round metal mound with a telescope eye a tear trickled down as he told me his story <br>
                                        <br>
                                        His tale was a blur, I couldn’t make out the words, I said, “Slow down, begin at the beginning, and, start with your name.” <br>
                                        <br>

                                        but then the Space Giant appeared and took the first bite <br>

                                        to turn you into a rocketship <br>
                                        <br>
                                        fly on back and speak with this Giant (Yeah) <br>

                                        We can ask it to please leave, and hope that it agrees <br>

                                        When I first heard I had quite a laugh <br>
                                        Look up in the sky, flying shark <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Teeth like knives that bite in half <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Things get weird. I take up the slack <br>
                                        I’m the man for the job or I’ll eat my hat <br>
                                        Laser-guided orcas live without water <br>
                                        Fitted with wings, engines, mortars <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Old-fashioned grit and I fire like this <br>
                                        “Let me try” -oh I insist! <br>
                                        Aim, fire, strike with a tiny risk- <br>
                                        Oh blimey, spoke too soon- I missed <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Shark repellent is ineffective <br>
                                        London's done for chums, I’ve wrecked it <br>
                                        Sharks are landing, grey and vicious <br>
                                        On the other hand this hat tastes delicious <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Rabbit: Well, we’ve tried everything, what else can we do? <br>
                                        Hatchworth: I hear there’s still safe houses left in Old Peru <br>
                                        Spine: Please heed our warning, these sharks will never tire <br>
                                        Hatchworth: Wait a second, hold on, did anyone think about using… fire? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Rabbit: Huh… fire. <br>
                                        Hey Hatchworth, hand me that stick over there <br>
                                        Professor, do you have a lighter? <br>
                                        Professor: Oh yes I’ve got one here, there you go <br>
                                        Rabbit: Thanks. <br>
                                        Back, back! <br>
                                        That’s a bad sky shark! <br>
                                        Back, back! <br>
                                        Oh my gosh, it’s working! Ah it’s working, guys! <br>
                                        They’re leaving! We’ve done it! We’ve done it! <br>
                                        Spread the word, guys, they don’t like fire! <br>
                                        Crier: They hate fire, spread the word! <br>
                                        <br>
                                        So be wary of the Sky Sharks <br>
                                        They want to nom on your blood <br>
                                        If you want to have a future <br>
                                        Heed my warning or you'll lose it <br>
                                        Please avoid their dreaded eye ray <br>
                                        Run and hide and fight another day <br>
                                        Practice cardio, increase your pace <br>
                                        Let’s preserve the human race <br>

                                        In the life I led in my past <br>
                                        I tried to live by the earth <br>
                                        The cosmos seemed so far away <br>
                                        But I now know <br>
                                        My place is among the stars <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Back in time in the depths of space <br>
                                        there was a little girl born to the human race <br>
                                        She had fire in her eyes <br>
                                        She was brimming with hyper cosmic ultra vibes <br>
                                        <br>
                                        My squad had just deployed <br>
                                        When she came of age and visited our world <br>
                                        <br>
                                        She was a <br>
                                        Daughter of space <br>

                                        <br>
                                        Her laser hair cut through beams of steel <br>
                                        Her claws of energy cracked my canopy <br>
                                        Her sonic voice smashed my deflectors into pieces <br>
                                        The cabin depressurized, I hit my escape releases <br>

                                        I floated around for an hour or so <br>
                                        She had wiped out my squad now my oxygen was low <br>
                                        She soared right next to me <br>
                                        Her freckles glowed of cosmic energies <br>
                                        <br>
                                        My suit was falling apart <br>
                                        but right before I passed out she took me in her energy field <br>
                                        I was spared by the <br>

                                        Her laser hair ripped moons in two <br>
                                        Her claws grasped a comet and we flew <br>
                                        Her sonic voice lulled me to sleep with deep conversation <br>

                                        Me and my girl went down to the fields to see what we could see <br>
                                        <br>
                                        one thousand degrees it was in my mind… It was sunny and bright (and bright) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        We couldn't find any shade for several miles around us <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I cried out for rain or just for a nice tall glass of iced lemonade (lemonade) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I would have given anything for that day to turn into a night (a night) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        As we laid in the fields I looked up and said with all my might (my might) <br>

                                        <br>

                                        I received a telescope, I was so happy I went outside with it to play (to play) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I stopped dead in my tracks when I realized the sun <br>
                                        <br>
                                        was casting all its rays across the sky masking all the stars (the stars) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I would have given anything for that day to turn into a night (a night) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        As I sat with my telescope I shouted with all my might (my might) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I'd kick down the sun for a star valley night <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I said, I'd kick down the sun for a star valley night <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Star valley night <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Walking down the street headed towards the annual circus <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I saw an elephant escape a tent and overturn a cannon (a cannon) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The cannon shot a clown several blocks away into a factory <br>
                                        <br>
                                        and that factory was filled with fireworks and they all went off at once (at once) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I would have given anything for that day to turn into a night (a night) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        As multicolored lights exploded in the blue sky I cried (I cried) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I'd kick down the sun for a star valley night <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I said, I'd kick down the sun for a star valley night <br>

                                        <br>
                                        Me and my girl went down to the fields to scream at the sun <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Go Away, Go away <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I'd kick down the sun for a star valley night <br>

                                        Burning in the stratosphere <br>
                                        Looks like there’s no place to run <br>
                                        I know that I have a heart <br>

                                        We’ve got the Cosmo’s distress signal <br>
                                        You were hit by an unknown force <br>
                                        An energy with Earth as it’s source <br>
                                        <br>
                                        What’s your status? <br>
                                        This is flight Engineer Dwight <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Ground Control, do you read? <br>
                                        The explosion, it hit Walter! Hit him right in the chest <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I’m losing air, I’m spinning out <br>
                                        High above the Earth <br>
                                        I don’t think I can hold on much longer <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The story says he saved Dwight <br>
                                        Filled his lungs with air <br>
                                        And he returned him through the atmosphere without a bruise, or scrape, or tear <br>

                                        He rocketed into outer space just by thinking about flight <br>
                                        <br>
                                        There was no explanation how he did what he did. <br>
                                        He unearthed special powers from his deep cosmic id <br>
                                        He could eat thirty moons and still eat thirty-five more. <br>
                                        And his super space muscles were hard to ignore. <br>

                                        And if you’ve got some extra time, could you send those spider demons back to hell? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Commander Cosmo™ save us! <br>

                                        But the ring, it came too late <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Decades flew by but she would cherish him <br>
                                        No matter his final fate. <br>
                                        Commander Walter, save him <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Save him in your heart <br>
                                        Find peace inside the black of the dark Necrostar <br>
                                        Commander Cosmo, save us <br>
                                        it’ll never be the same <br>
                                        There’s nothing left to save us, and the vice is what to blame <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Commander Cosmo, save us <br>

                                        Oh hey QWERTY, where did everyone go? <br>
                                        The guys were supposed to come to my recital <br>
                                        I was gonna belch the entire score to Cats! <br>
                                        Wow, I can see why no one would come to that <br>
                                        Man, what do you know anyway? <br>
                                        I know that I would rather wipe my entire hard drive than go to your recital <br>
                                        Whatever, your simplistic hardware can't appreciate my musical genius anyway <br>
                                        You're in the presence of the next big starlet <br>
                                        My data suggests otherwise <br>

                                        You're awful, just awful <br>
                                        Please do not ever perform again <br>
                                        Why you little d-! <br>

                                        Steve! <br>
                                        Oh, what's the deal, GG? <br>
                                        I went to your recital but you weren't there <br>
                                        I was gonna perform, but nobody showed up <br>
                                        Well, I showed up, didn't I just say I showed up? <br>
                                        How can you say nobody showed up when I just showed up? <br>
                                        How about I show you up right now, you showed up- <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Get it together, man <br>
                                        I'm sorry, thank you, QWERTY <br>
                                        I've just been going a little nuts house-sitting by myself <br>
                                        While Peter and the family are out of town and the robots are travelling through space <br>
                                        What? Exposition? Robots? Space? And they didn't invite me? <br>
                                        Well, they said it was some kind of musical space adventure trip <br>
                                        And they only needed robots that could handle the rigors of musical space travel <br>
                                        What? I'm a perfect musical space-ready robot! <br>

                                        To play along to the arbitrary lyrics that will no doubt issue forth from your mechanical maw? <br>

                                        But she’s got that look that says <br>
                                        she knows just where she wants to go <br>

                                        She’s shiner than The Spine <br>
                                        and Rabbit ain't got nothing on her moves <br>

                                        You should send me gifts because if you don't, that'd be horrible <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I want a Lamborghini and a bucket of kittens <br>
                                        I don't have thumbs, but I could use some mittens <br>
                                        <br>
                                        covered in gemstones <br>
                                        and maybe some super-expensive headphones <br>
                                        The kind with the super-deep bass sound <br>
                                        So I can jam out to the max around town <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I actually don’t get to leave the house much, but <br>
                                        <br>
                                        (Chorus) <br>

                                        ALRIGHT, KAZOO SOLO! <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I have lots of friends all across the world <br>
                                        They just haven't ever called, or even ever met this lonesome girl <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But I have a gazillion followers on the social streams <br>
                                        I haven't met them all, but I am sure that they love me <br>
                                        because I am so genuine <br>
                                        Oh and I just remembered I always wanted a penguin <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You know the kind that wear fancy bow ties <br>
                                        and serve you dinner just like they do for Mary Poppins and that Dick Van Dyke guy <br>
                                        I guess it would also be kind of neat <br>
                                        if that penguin could keep a beat with his happy feet <br>
                                        So send one straight to my door <br>
                                        I’m sure they've got one down at your local penguin store <br>
                                        and make sure you send along some ice <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Because I think they need that to survive but I’m too small to reach the freezer in the kitchen and maybe I could reach it with a step stool, but oh no wait the penguin still needs ice during shipment so maybe you could put some ice in the box with it and maybe that would just get wet, and it would break... <br>
                                        <br>
                                        ‘kay, instead <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Gravity, it makes no sense to me <br>
                                        but it pulls me, just like you do <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The higher I am, the harder into ground I will slam <br>
                                        it will kill me, it’ll be messy <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Here I am, planted on the ground and waiting, waiting for it to pull me <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If my logic isn’t sound, what’s keeping our feet on the ground? <br>
                                        An equation, or special occasion <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Don’t get me wrong, I’d rather be up in the clouds, <br>
                                        but I’d worry, about coming down <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Here we are, feeling worlds apart, yet sharing, the pull of gravity <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Is it wrong, is it wrong, to be pulled along, by a song <br>
                                        <br>
                                        By now, I should have it all figured out, <br>
                                        but you’ve pulled my outer space apart <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If Gravity is embrace, and time the love we chase, <br>
                                        well my darling, you must be a star <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Here I am, a meteoric stance as I give in, into the pulls <br>

                                        Then particles of light could seethe <br>

                                        then break apart and vaporize <br>
                                        The stars could explode and boil Earth’s seas <br>
                                        and rip the fabric of reality <br>

                                        Hold me til the mornin’ light <br>

                                        You craved me <br>
                                        You saved me <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Saved me from my own foolish blight <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You’re gone now <br>
                                        I’m strong now <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Strong enough to cry only at night <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I see now  <br>
                                        It can’t be now <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Now that you’re away <br>
                                        <br>
                                        And I wish that I could be like the desert <br>
                                        He never seems to cry <br>
                                        I wish that I could be like the ocean <br>
                                        She never needs to ask why <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I’m a lonely lady only <br>

                                        Saved me from myself <br>

                                        And I wish that I could be like my father <br>
                                        He always knew what was right <br>
                                        I wish that I could be like my mother <br>
                                        She always tucked me in tight <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I’m a lonely lady only <br>

                                        You’d hold me <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Hold me til the mornin’ light <br>

                                        I wake up and no else is around, but her. <br>
                                        There's no one to tell us what to do. <br>
                                        We're all alone with all our dreams to see through <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The lack of gravity's been a little weird <br>
                                        but I don't miss it all <br>
                                        I’m floating around and I cannot fall <br>
                                        As I cross the stars <br>
                                        As I cross the stars <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I took the time <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I took love <br>
                                        and then combined <br>
                                        and got an indescribable feeling <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I sailed the seas <br>

                                        Oh, it's out of this world <br>

                                        But thanks to her now I'll always know. <br>

                                        became alive with a new being <br>
                                        She soaked up all the dreams I'd seen <br>
                                        and transformed them to reality <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The speed of light, the speed of light, the speed of light <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I am the speed of light, no, we’re the speed of light, her and I are the speed of light <br>

                                        Whoo! What a trip <br>
                                        Deflector shields powered up <br>
                                        The S.S. Alexander is at 80% integrity <br>
                                        Well, shoot, that's not bad considering where we are <br>
                                        Rav, it is my recommendation that we retreat in access <br>
                                        The ship cannot withstand the heat from this star <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Ah, thank you, Gidget, thank you <br>
                                        Point taken, but I don't care <br>
                                        Wow, look at it, it's a beauty, kinda <br>
                                        Only had to cross, like, five dimensions to get here <br>
                                        Jumbo sure knows how to set up a dimensional fortress, don't he? <br>
                                        Booplex, get the bomb drone <br>
                                        Booplex! <br>
                                        That's right, your name's Booplex <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Is that what I think it is? <br>
                                        Well, that depends on what you think it is <br>
                                        Uh, if you think it's a bomb to blow up the sun, then you'd be right <br>
                                        How else are we gonna get the Commander out? <br>
                                        Commander? <br>
                                        Oh dear, Rav, it is imperative that we leave <br>
                                        This star might go supernova <br>
                                        Yeah, that's what I'm counting on <br>
                                        And you just thought that Starburner was a pretty little title, huh? <br>
                                        Alright Booplex, let's get out of here <br>
                                        Booplex! <br>
                                        Rav, we have company <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Who disturbs the sacred fortress? <br>
                                        Who would meddle in my domain? <br>
                                        Oh hey, Jumbo! You're still a giant space whale, that's, that's cool <br>
                                        Starburner <br>
                                        Good for you, man! <br>
                                        You know, your brethren had the right idea <br>
                                        You know, leaving the Vice Quadrant, going to Vacation Planet, I think <br>
                                        But that's alright, you chose to be a guardian of space and time or something <br>
                                        Whatever you call yourself, that's cool, man, that's cool <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You know, there are two space gods tearing up the cosmos <br>
                                        And you're just sitting here <br>
                                        Well, I'm about to do something about it <br>
                                        What are you doing? <br>
                                        You might want to step back <br>
                                        Starburner! <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Oh, what is that? <br>
                                        That little purple streak of light? <br>
                                        Well, that's the Commander <br>
                                        Boy, he looks, he looks pretty mad <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Halt in the name of Chronos and the order of the infinity <br>
                                        Return to your prison or- <br>
                                        Oh! Ah, squashed him like a bug <br>
                                        Whoa, Commander, whoo <br>
                                        Too bad no one got that on video <br>
                                        Seeing the Commander punch a whale in the face <br>
                                        It was pretty cool <br>
                                        Oh well, at least we got the audio logs <br>
                                        Commander, it's all you <br>
                                        Starburner out <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Alright, Gidget, how about some flying music? <br>
                                        This is my favorite song <br>

                                        Starlight, starshine, please come back into my life <br>
                                        You left me all alone, can't you see that my, heart’s your home <br>
                                        <br>
                                        There's a void in my soul (and it leaves me feeling cold) <br>
                                        Will I ever find peace from it's tolls <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Starlight, starshine, all of my mind couldn't unwind <br>
                                        What it was, what it'll be, what future can I hope to see <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I am not in a dream (and there's no reason to scream) <br>
                                        And this is not the end, or so it seems <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You were like starlight, just like starshine <br>
                                        Casting down on me <br>
                                        <br>
                                        When the light would go down and the darkness was found <br>
                                        You would shine hope to me <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Starlight, starshine, no longer do you shine so bright <br>
                                        The sun frowns, the moon sighs, sad is the universe through my eyes <br>
                                        <br>
                                        l am not just a machine (through my heart I will sing) <br>
                                        I'm just a person holding onto a dream <br>

                                        pleading his demands, to the robot band <br>

                                        Rav: “Please hear my plight, to save the green apple in the sky, from the space giant’s appetite, for depraved delights. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He followed W.I.N.K. the satellite, W.I.N.K.’s trail of blue matter bright, the giant’s got a one-track mind, and will eat everything just to find the robot band.” <br>
                                        <br>
                                        What'll you say, when asked to saved the day, what would you do to save a world? <br>

                                        Launched into space to save the human race and the green apple in the sky <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Ride W.I.N.K. the Satellite into endless night, at speeds of near light <br>
                                        The journey long, the destination nigh, the green apple planet-sized <br>
                                        And missing a bite, alone in the night, W.I.N.K. shuddered with delight <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In the Vice Quadrant, there loomed the Space Giant, it’s grin the horizon, it had found the band <br>
                                        <br>
                                        SG: “Finally you’ve come, the parallel universe I’m from <br>
                                        Steam Powered Giraffe is done, they left a hole in me <br>
                                        So I’ve come all this way, all the while my appetite could not be sate so I want one last show, before I go.” <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But first, the Space Giant needed proof that this truly was Steam Powered Giraffe, so it proposed a duel and revealed a guitar made out of the cosmos. The ensuing duel would come to be known as the most awesome duel in all the universe. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The duel ended. The Space Giant streamed tears like waterfalls under the green apple sky, healing her, and giving her a salty ocean. During the course of Steam Powered Giraffe’s impromptu performance, the Space Giant shrunk down into the Space Miniscule, and then into Nothing At All. The robots and W.I.N.K. returned to Earth. There, W.I.N.K. spoke his final words. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        “My friends return home, I must journey alone, to the green apple in the sky, <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If there’s a thing called love, it waits for me above, it’s time for goodbyes.” <br>
                                        <br>
                                        W.I.N.K. your bravery, will not be forgotten, your love will not be lost <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The Space Giant gone, Earth’s peace prolonged, humanity carries on… at least for now <br>

                                        The darkness of space of was broken when a beam of light emerged and awoken <br>
                                        all the crew aboard the Spacecraft Delarue <br>
                                        <br>
                                        A man appeared outside the ship and he was pale as snow as the earth was blue <br>
                                        It couldn't be him, hadn't he died long ago? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Dressed in a tattered space suit, his helmet smashed, his eyes glowing so bright <br>
                                        <br>
                                        With the grip of his hands he tore through the hull, dooming the ship and every woman and man <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Oh no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (x4) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        He zoomed away with that daughter of space and they headed to the moon as the Delarue was lost <br>
                                        just two streaks of light, oh the destruction they wrought <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Beams of energy shot from his hands and lasers flew from her hair as she whipped her head around <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Moon Base Delta Six, you didn't stand a chance <br>
                                        <br>
                                        They ripped through Moon Base Gamma One, then blew up Alpha Seven and Omega Three through Eight <br>
                                        Hundreds of poor souls were trapped inside, they didn't see it coming how could anyone hope to survive <br>

                                        I can always count on you through everything <br>
                                        And you'll keep me moving on… right? <br>

                                        I feel it. I taste it. I crave it. I feel alive! <br>

                                        Wail at the terror. It devours you whole. <br>

                                        I’ve always hungered for their plight <br>
                                        But with my human mind now, it just feels right! <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I’ve chewed on ghosts lost in the stars <br>
                                        I’ve mingled with the Wither Lords; those cats are bizarre. <br>

                                        or gave the Space Giant SPG’s awful jams? <br>

                                        Commander Walter picked me personally to kill him too <br>
                                        And I of course obliged, or at least I tried to <br>
                                        But not even my dark heart could beat or gore <br>
                                        or swallow the red in his core <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But oh what a taste and oh what a thrill <br>
                                        And now that he’s gone I feel my tendrils spill. <br>
                                        Go forth little darlings, go forth to Sol. <br>
                                        Gather their little hearts for me to slurp from my bowl. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I love all the envy <br>
                                        And fear you create <br>
                                        Fill up my black <br>
                                        toxic heart with your hate <br>

                                        Don’t try to hide <br>

                                        Hatchworth, Hatchworth, look! <br>
                                        Hmm? Huh? <br>

                                        Uh, look, I'm really tired, I don't even know how <br>
                                        But uh, we've got a lot of light years until our destination <br>
                                        So I'm gonna go and try sleeping for the first time <br>
                                        A little shut-eye <br>
                                        Aw, she's beautiful! <br>
                                        (I'm just gonna back out of this...) <br>
                                        Oh my gosh, there's a little one <br>
                                        There's a little one, look, a baby! <br>
                                        Aw, it's like a whale cub <br>
                                        Oh my... <br>
                                        This gives me an idea for a song <br>
                                        Let's see, let's just grab the accordion here... <br>
                                        <br>

                                        You're a big, big whale <br>
                                        No, that's not good... <br>

                                        <br>

                                        I'm trying to beat my high score of Super Space Blaster Centi-Asteroid Invaderpedes 2 <br>

                                        like I’m not like the rest or any other guy <br>
                                        It's the way we talk and the way we sing <br>
                                        about the universe and every little thing <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Well I don't have name for it, <br>
                                        been trying to find a name for it, <br>
                                        I don't think there's a name for it, <br>
                                        but it's kinda like being in love <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All - I’m - say-ing is what my <br>
                                        Heart - is - play-ing on its <br>
                                        Strings - so - loud -ly its <br>
                                        feelings - de-clared- proudly <br>
                                        <br>
                                        This - feeling - is - staying because my <br>
                                        Heart - is - blaze-ing it’s on <br>

                                        It won’t go out <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Well it's the way she can twirl on the face of a dime <br>
                                        and the way she's always there like my partner in crime <br>
                                        It's the curl of her hair and the gleam of her eyes <br>
                                        and the heart in her chest that beats in rhythm with mine <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Well I don't have name for it, <br>
                                        been trying to find a name for it, <br>

                                        but it's kind of like being <br>

                                        and people gasp when they realize that the car matches the color of my eyes <br>

                                        Spine: <br>
                                        My head is rocking back and forth, synced to the beat <br>
                                        And all the while I’m tapping the dance floor with my feet <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Hatchworth: <br>
                                        Point to the ceiling just before the music comes on (Spine: dance floor, dance floor oh) <br>
                                        and no one will be prepared, for my moves at they will have stared (Spine: dance, dance, dance, dance dance) <br>

                                        Spine: He once knew a gnat, his name was Pat <br>
                                        Rabbit: He liked to chat, but his pitch was flat <br>
                                        Hatchworth: My friend went splat, where she at? <br>
                                        Spine: was she flying with her homies like a leaf-nosed bat <br>
                                        into a big vat <br>
                                        Hatchworth: of strawberry fruit snacks <br>
                                        losing all her health stats because of that? <br>

                                        Rabbit: The woman's creed and code were true <br>

                                        Hatchworth: Sleep tight tonight <br>

                                        And Death and her are friends now no matter where it is she goes <br>
                                        So all the Vampires should hide from this lady <br>
                                        This side of the netherworld, she’s the baddest in Hades <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Hatchworth: All the sugar skulls sing her praise, Delilah Morreo <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Spine: There ain't no ghost or specter that’ll stand with her toe to toe <br>
                                        Rabbit: The demon boys love her, it turns the Banshees green <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Spine: But there ain’t no man for this Vampire Queen <br>
                                        <br>
                                        (Chorus) <br>

                                        Well hello there, <br>
                                        <br>
                                        did you have a nice day? <br>
                                        I can tell by the look on your face, <br>
                                        <br>
                                        you've got some things on your plate <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I am your robot, (Beep-bop, beep) <br>
                                        May I please take your bags? (Bobbidy-beep) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Feel free to deposit your worries <br>
                                        into the metaphorical trash <br>
                                        <br>
                                        That passive aggression, will do you no good <br>
                                        Try the direct approach, then a solution we might broach <br>
                                        Once we move past it, we gotta think about tomorrow, <br>
                                        I'll take care of the chores, the critical thinking is yours <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You must remember, you're only human, <br>
                                        and you've come so far, don't give up now <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You gotta keep going, keep your wits about you, <br>
                                        face adversity, remain complex and incomplete <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Hold it right there (stop) <br>
                                        Give me that can of beans (hand it over) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I will open it for you, you've got better things to do <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Do not worry (let it go) <br>
                                        about little ol' me, (ain’t no thing) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I was built for this, my purpose is your ease <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If you're having difficulties, going to sleep, <br>
                                        let me sing you a song, help you drift along <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Close your eyes, relax your limbs, <br>
                                        open your mind, let the dreams begin <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Just remember, to stand before you fly <br>
                                        You're human only once, so give it a good try <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Follow your nose, or just follow your heart, <br>
                                        Oh the choice is up to you, nobody else but you <br>
                                        While you were asleep I was contemplating <br>
                                        Maybe I'm only human with rusted metal plating <br>
                                        and you're the robot, under constant repair <br>
                                        But that's just silly, why would a robot have hair <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I can make life simple, (ones and zeroes) <br>
                                        you can make mine...obsolete (but please don’t) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Your memories they stick, mine I can’t delete <br>
                                        <br>
                                        We can both fake a smile, we can be confused at times <br>
                                        We can both write poetry, and match simple rhymes <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You must remember, you're only human <br>
                                        You've got a ways to go, so put on a good show <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Keep it murky, or make it crystal clear, <br>
                                        Oh, the choice is up to you, no one but beautiful you <br>

                                        Disconcerting. I will never be free <br>
                                        I want the world to know <br>
                                        That I am in control <br>
                                        As they look upon my broken soul <br>
                                        They’ll say “she was her own worst foe” <br>

                                        Save me, love <br>
                                        Keep your vow <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Find some nerve <br>
                                        For this coward now <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Sleep evil, sleep <br>
                                        It’s all just in my head <br>
                                        Come the morning sun <br>
                                        I’ll fight the same demons yet again <br>
                                        You can weld me to my knees <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But I won’t pray for mercy, no <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Sleep evil, sleep, <br>
                                        tonight you are dead  <br>

                                        put ourselves out to sea <br>

                                        All the neon fires fired in our brains <br>
                                        We were thinking that our world was in <br>
                                        danger <br>
                                        But then we entered the fray <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All the rest they could <br>

                                        must have been a sign <br>

                                        burn two giant holes <br>
                                        straight in my heart <br>
                                        my love spills out <br>
                                        conquers you whole <br>
                                        Now we're swimming <br>
                                        <br>
                                        around in the love <br>
                                        <br>
                                        and it soaks into our skin <br>
                                        though mine is metal <br>
                                        and yours is flesh. <br>
                                        our differences make this the best <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Love in town and we skip to every <br>
                                        destination <br>
                                        we're putting on show everywhere we go <br>
                                        sparks fly from my lips <br>
                                        its an electric kiss <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Static’s abound, frequency sounds <br>
                                        hand in hand we dance around <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I'm generating lots of love holding your hand <br>
                                        They can hear our motors turning across the land <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All our love well it <br>
                                        put us at ease and it <br>
                                        Somehow made time freeze <br>
                                        And it seemed like it’d never end <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Both of our hearts seemed to <br>
                                        Intertwine, when <br>
                                        We met for the first time <br>
                                        And now I can’t stop thinking about those <br>
                                        <br>

                                        <br>
                                        Hope is very hard when <br>
                                        Hope is very hard when you've <br>
                                        lost the thing you had before <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I took all the right steps <br>
                                        I took all the right steps and I <br>
                                        unlocked the right doors <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All the neon fires died out in my brain <br>
                                        And I grew numb to that feeling of <br>
                                        pain <br>
                                        why did you have to go <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All the rest they could <br>

                                        And now the story of Leopold Expeditus... <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Born, oh I suppose in 1812, Leopold’s mother a mademoiselle. His father, the General whisked them away, to a colony in Africa where they would stay. They’d irrigate the land and teach mathematics, but then a surprise attack, the warlords wouldn’t have it. Direwolves appeared, to search for scraps amongst the ashes, they found young Leopold, hidden in the water brackish. Mother wolf raised Leopold, as her own critter, and paired him up with, the runt of the litter. Its name was Taki Büm Büm, brave as a pup could be, along with Leo’s smarts, a more adept team you’re not likely to meet... <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Taki Büm Büm and Leopold Expeditus, where are you off to now? Where will you guide us? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Taki Büm Büm and Leopold Expeditus, your journey  begins here, and soon you will unite us. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Leopold sprouted his first chest hair, and then grew bored of doggy dares. His peach fuzz turned mustache, his curiosity never abashed, he swam the Balearic Sea, and enrolled in university. He learned to chart maps, graduated top of his class, his peers shyed away, they could never truly grasp. Reared in the wild, an abandoner of his pack, with newfound knowledge he would embrace his canine past. Leopold made his way back to the African continent, He searched the northern lands, for their scent. He followed a trail, to a Dire Wolf den, reunited with his friend, their adventures would soon begin... <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Taki Büm Büm and Leopold Expeditus, where are you off to now? Where will you guide us? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Taki Büm Büm and Leopold Expeditus, Explore Africa, discovery the impetus. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Near the Gulf Of Guinea they tried to teach a cannibal tribe, to instead eat produce, they barely escaped with their hides. In the Basin of Congo they found, iridescent colossi, tried to enact a trade they were, nearly thrown into the sky. They crossed the Saharan Desert, explored the Egyptian pyramids. They swam the Nile River and even tried to tame the Jaguar Basilisk. In Mozambique they steered, clear of the blue glowing fissure, but failed to reunite, a baby rhino with its lost herd... <br>
                                        <br>
                                        What are you looking for Leopold Expeditus? What are you searching for in the middle of the desert? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        What are you doing it all for Leopold Expeditus? What are you searching for in the middle of nowhere? <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But one night Taki Büm Büm, heard a howl at the moon, and left Leo’s side in the middle of the night. For twenty four weeks and sixty two days, Leopold waited for his friend to come back in sight. “Day two hundred thirty, old Büm Büm has yet to return. I should move on, yet, I am compelled to stay and wait. Taki, mon ami poilu. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If you’re out there, please, give me a sign. Sacrebleu! Ca fait longtemps!” <br>
                                        <br>
                                        “They crested the Dunes, There were at least seven, A Dire Wolf parade, it could not be mistaken. I did not recognize their faces, but I knew their patterns, they are Taki Büm Büm’s Litter, they have the same hunger for adventure! HeHa! On y va!” <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Leopold and his pack, travelled as a brigade, reformed those cannibals with creme brulee. They even managed to trade, man-flambé, for extra large slacks, iridescent colossi made. Charted many oases, of the Saharan desert, they tamed the Jaguar Basilisk, and no one got real hurt. They waded deep into, the blue glowing fissure, pulled out the Rhino’s crash, the excitement could not be dashed... <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Explorer Leopold, Wolfkin Expeditus, Seven Büm Büm Pups, Fear can bite us! <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On to Europe, and then onto Asia, we’ll trot the entire globe, it’s mysteries can’t escape us. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        “Taki Büm Büm, you and your kin, on multiple occasions saved my skin. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        People may cheer, Leopold Expeditus, but I’ll always know, our friendship was the tightest. HeHa! On y va.”  <br>

                                        I can't see, I can't see, across the crowds <br>
                                        <br>
                                        A sea of clouds and unseen dreams <br>
                                        <br>
                                        They're screaming loud <br>

                                        But how they dance on second glance <br>

                                        they're smiling proud <br>

                                        But they are all left unseen <br>
